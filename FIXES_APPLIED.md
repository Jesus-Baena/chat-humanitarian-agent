# Fixes Applied - October 17, 2025

## Summary
Fixed production chat application that was completely non-functional. Chat now works end-to-end with AI responses streaming successfully.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Navigation Blocking Issue ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Supabase auth module was intercepting navigation to `/chat/*` routes and redirecting back to `/`
**Solution**: Added `/chat/*` to `redirectOptions.exclude` in `nuxt.config.ts`

```typescript
supabase: {
  redirectOptions: {
    login: '/',
    callback: '/',
    exclude: ['/', '/chat/*'], // ← Added this
  }
}
```

### 2. Missing Flowise Environment Variables ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Production Docker build didn't include Flowise config (URL and API key)
**Solution**: 
- Updated `Dockerfile` with Flowise build args
- Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to pass secrets as build args
- Updated `swarm-infra/web/docker-compose.yml` to remove hardcoded secrets

### 3. Message Persistence Blocking UI ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: `persistMessage()` was awaited, blocking the UI if database insert failed
**Solution**: Changed to fire-and-forget pattern - messages are persisted asynchronously without blocking the chat flow

## Current State

### ✅ Working
- Navigation from home to chat pages
- Message input and sending
- **AI responses streaming successfully**
- Flowise API integration
- Component lifecycle (mount/unmount)
- Supabase authentication (anonymous sessions)

### ⚠️ Known Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Router warnings**: `No match found for location with path "/login?..."` 
   - These are cosmetic warnings from components creating route refs
   - Do not affect functionality
   - Partially fixed by removing unused login button

2. **POST /messages returns 500**
   - Chat still works because persistence is fire-and-forget
   - AI responses stream successfully despite this error
   - Need to investigate database schema or permissions
   - **Action needed**: Check server logs for actual database error

3. **MDC Slot Warning**: `Slot "default" invoked outside of the render function`
   - Cosmetic warning from Markdown Components library
   - Does not affect functionality

## Files Modified

### Core Fixes
- `nuxt.config.ts` - Added `/chat/*` to redirect exclusions
- `Dockerfile` - Added Flowise build arguments
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Pass Flowise secrets as build args
- `app/composables/useChat.ts` - Made persistMessage fire-and-forget
- `app/components/UserMenu.vue` - Removed login button causing router warnings

### Debug Logging Added (can be removed)
- `app/components/ChatInput.vue`
- `app/components/ChatWindow.vue`
- `app/components/HelpPrompt.vue`
- `app/pages/index.vue`
- `app/pages/chat/[id].vue`

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Debug the POST /messages 500 error**
   - Check server terminal for `[messages.post] Database error` logs
   - Likely schema issue, constraint violation, or RLS policy
   - Once fixed, messages will persist to database properly

2. **Remove Debug Logging**
   - Clean up console.log statements from components
   - Remove lifecycle logging hooks

3. **Deploy to Production**
   - Once message persistence is fixed
   - Build new Docker image via GitHub Actions
   - Deploy to Docker Swarm

### Medium Priority
1. Fix router warnings by defining proper login/profile routes or removing refs
2. Consider adding error boundaries for better error handling
3. Add retry logic for failed message persistence

### Low Priority
1. Investigate MDC slot warning (cosmetic)
2. Consider adding loading states for message persistence
3. Add user feedback for failed persistence attempts

## Deployment Status

- **Current Image**: ghcr.io/jesus-baena/chat-humanitarian-agent:latest
- **Commit**: b95a97f2dd529e45fbfff5f69b7bb29e6acc4cb2
- **Running**: 2 replicas (dnipro, kyiv nodes)
- **Status**: Deployed but needs one more fix for full functionality

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check Docker Swarm service
docker service ps web_chat

# Check container logs
docker service logs web_chat --tail 50

# Test Flowise API
curl -X POST https://flowise.baena.site/api/v1/prediction/40718af9-e9bd-47d9-a57b-009cb26f8fe3 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer FO5JgBFwXMPQDE_XrgDn8FSYpGbgtyeZ2h7YlJd-Skk" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "test"}'

# Check Supabase connection
# (via test-chat.html or direct API calls)
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Nuxt auth modules can silently intercept routes** - Always check `redirectOptions.exclude`
2. **NUXT_PUBLIC_* variables must be build-time configured** - Runtime env vars don't work for public config
3. **Fire-and-forget pattern useful for non-critical operations** - Don't block UI for optional persistence
4. **Test with minimal HTML first** - `test-chat.html` proved APIs worked, narrowed issue to integration
5. **Vue Router warnings can be misleading** - Often cosmetic, doesn't mean routes don't work
